# sortAlgorithms
 a compilation of sorting algorithms found in Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest

This repository is meant both as a learning resource and practice
for understanding of sorting algorithms
tested for correctness on very large inputs

the approach for writing all of these is done first by hand for understanding and visualization,
then written in comments in unofficial PDL,
then implemented in Python, with some also being implemented in C++
